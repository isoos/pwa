In this folder you have some simple projects that show what __pwa__ can do.

Due to some OS limitations, there are two folders:

> __windows__, for projects that run only on Windows. This is because some dependencies are able to run only up to a specific version.

> __general__ for Linux and Mac (not tested, but should be able to run).
