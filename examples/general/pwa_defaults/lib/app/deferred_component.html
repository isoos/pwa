  If you have a modern browser with ServiceWorker support, some of
  these will be served from cache the next time. Try reloading the
  page, and experiment what happens when the network is offline. In
  Chrome:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Developer Console</li>
  <li>Switch to "Network" tab</li>
  <li>Turn on "Offline" and "Disable cache"</li>
  <li>Reload this page.</li>
</ul>
<div *ngFor="let item of images" style="display: inline-block; width: 240px; height: 180px;">
  <img [src]="item" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto;"/>
</div>
